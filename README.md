# AngChess
This is a simple chess web application made w/ Angular. 

# Goal:

The goal of this application was to gain experience with Angular, as I had little prior front end experience. 

The chess aspect of the application was designed to replicate the functionality of a real life chess board, i.e. there is no rule implementation. I originally intended to add game rules, but decided that it would distract me from my original goal of front-end familiarization. 

# Features:

The two graveyard panels on the right populate as the game progresses

# Current Bugs:

None detected at the moment; there was previously a nodeList iterator error but that was corrected.

# TODO:

I do not intend to expand the functionality of this app any further, however I am using it as a demo app to host on a github pages site, as well as routing my personal domain to this site.

Tutorial I used to host the app on github pages: ![Alligator.io](https://alligator.io/angular/deploying-angular-app-github-pages/)
Tutorial I am currently using to route my domain to the github page sire: ![Dev.to](https://dev.to/rightfrombasics/connecting-namecheap-domain-with-github-pages-3nn6)
