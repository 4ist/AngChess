The goal of this application was to gain experience with Angular, as I had little prior front end experience. 

The chess aspect of the application was designed to replicate the functionality of a real life chess board, i.e. there is no rule implementation. I originally intended to add game rules, but decided that it would distract me from my original goal of front-end familiarization. 

The code is generally structured according to the following UML diagram:
